Repo for experimental version of competition script (`sift_and_cnn.py`), SIFT testing, and letters CNN training + testing.

Copy the `sift_and_cnn.py`, `clue-banner-filled.png`, and `letter-recog-model.keras` (or `letter-recog-model.h5`) files to your competition directory (or somehow target the original files in here). Import the module `sift_and_cnn.py` like demonstrated in `sift_and_cnn_test.py` to use in the controller.

API documentation inside `sift_and_cnn.py` for `clueboard_img_from_frame` (currently using SIFT, under testing) and `clue_type_and_value` (CNN-based, also under testing and improvement) methods. 

The initial experimentation notebooks and development history up to Sunday Apr 7 are located at https://github.com/rcaerbannog/ENPH353_Local. (Let me know if unable to access.)
